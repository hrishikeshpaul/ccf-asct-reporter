## Playground
---

The latest feature, Playground, allows you to play around with a sample visualization, as well as upload your own data that can be visualized. This also comes with an in-house table that can be edited to see the changes in the visualization in real time. Uploading your sheet/data is temporary and once the page is refreshed the link is terminated.

#### Usage

1. To active playground mode, click on the *Playground* button on the toolbar.

   <br>

2. This should take you to an example visualization with just a handful of nodes.

   <br>
   <br>

3. There are 3 tabs,
   - **Visualization**: This is the default view which shows the visualization (as shown in the image above).
   - **Table**: This is a tabular view of the data. This is not a full featured table, just a basic view to do some quick edits. Alternatively, you can edit your sheet on Google Sheets and then head over to the Reporter, click on the Refresh button and get the latest data.

   - **Upload**: This is where you can upload your own sheet. In the input field, paste your Google Sheet URL from your browser and hit the **Link** button to visualize your data.

#### Note

In order for the playground feature to work properly, make sure,

- The sheet on Google Sheets has public access. The permissions on Google should look something like this,

   <br>
   <br>
- The data should be in the format specified [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bsA-HngthTD7NtzAfab8t3EVjFFT439-Pc-mp_mdZUU/edit#gid=0).
